ABout:
    -The React App uses React Router to create navigation routing which is seamless and helps to create and simplify a single page application .<br>
    -Used Api to fetch database from stack exchange for data representation.
    <br>
    -Also has a simplified camera app to capture photos , edit them and uplod them (dummy upload)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
